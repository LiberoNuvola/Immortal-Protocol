> **Authority:** this file is **not normative** and cannot change protocol semantics. Canonical Constitution/specifications and consolidated decisions remain authoritative.

**Repository:** `LiberoNuvola/Immortal-Protocol`  
**Working branch:** `work/immortal-green-closure`  
**Snapshot:** 2026-09-21  
**Latest observed commit at audit start:** `9fa9dd68ec5be9060e419326d891dd5505094b81` — `docs: close economic decision-boundary interface`

## 1. Mission

Bring IMMORTAL to technical, mathematical, architectural and documentary closure without regression.

Primary goals:

- make IMMORTAL / Adapter / PRE-RICH separation real, not merely nominal;
- formalize the economic state, obligations, exposure, liquidity and transitions;
- connect Economic Gate → Viability → Safe Action → Atomic Transition;
- prove local safety properties without overclaiming infinite-horizon viability;
- establish V3 ↔ Cardano semantic equivalence;
- close evidence/conformance fronts;
- isolate application-specific policy from the universal kernel;
- keep code, specifications, tests, proofs and documentation mutually consistent.

---

## 2. Authority hierarchy

When sources conflict, use:

1. current Constitution / canonical specifications;
2. consolidated Decision Register / explicit normative decisions;
3. current technical specifications;
4. implementation (evidence of what exists);
5. tests, proofs and verification artifacts;
6. checkpoints / simulations;
7. this coordination file;
8. chat / working notes;
9. legacy material.

Every substantive change must be triangulated against the relevant available sources before promotion.

---

## 3. Architecture boundary

### IMMORTAL — universal protocol/kernel

Only semantics that must remain true independently of a concrete application:

- canonical state;
- obligations;
- exposure;
- executable liquidity;
- ProtectedCapital;
- RawSurplus;
- Economic Gate;
- viability;
- safe actions;
- atomic transitions;
- state history;
- universal lifecycle semantics;
- universal economic safety properties.

### Adapter

Concrete realization of IMMORTAL in an execution environment (currently Cardano):

- state translation / serialization;
- UTxO, datum, redeemer and validity interval handling;
- external-input transport;
- transaction construction/signing/submission;
- observation and evidence production.

Adapter must not independently decide economic admissibility.

### PRE-RICH

Application/profile policy:

- ticket ladder;
- payout multipliers;
- GameRules and outcome distribution;
- Jackpot;
- economic parameters such as KA/KC/KD;
- application-specific expiry/funding policy.

---

## 4. Closed decisions — do not silently reopen

### Ticket expiry

- `365 days` is **not** a canonical IMMORTAL constant.
- DApp/profile determines a deterministic horizon from authoritative issuance state and declared policy.
- The crystallized horizon belongs to the ticket at issuance.
- Terminal semantics: `UNRESOLVED → EXPIRED`.
- After expiry: no claimability, new liability, resurrection or new payment commitment.
- Late reveal has zero economic effect.
- Exact DApp function and implementation/conformance remain implementation work.

### Jackpot

Jackpot is PRE-RICH/application policy, not a mandatory IMMORTAL primitive.

Current PRE-RICH floor:

`J_floor(S) = 500 × max(ΣP_normal, ΣP_saleable(S))`

Funding need:

`FundingNeed(S) = max(0, J_floor(S) − J_locked(S))`

Funding must be atomically admissible.

Do not resurrect the historical 10M / 20M / 50M / 100M / 250M ladder as universal law.

### Jackpot allocation

No canonical universal `JackpotAllocationRate`. Funding is determined by the required state-derived amount subject to economic admissibility.

### PRE-RICH ticket ladder

`1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 10 / 25 / 50 / 100` is application policy, not IMMORTAL law.

### PRE-RICH payout ceiling

`500×` is a PRE-RICH parameter, not a universal IMMORTAL constant.

---

## 5. Core economic chain

Do not collapse solvency into safety or viability.

Required semantic chain:

`Canonical State`
→ `Economic Delta`
→ `Candidate Post-State`
→ `ProtectedCapital`
→ `RawSurplus`
→ `Economic Gate`
→ `Viability`
→ `Safe Action`
→ `Atomic Transition`
→ `Post-State`
→ `State History`

Local invariant preservation is not, by itself, an infinite-horizon viability proof.

---

## 6. Active fronts

| ID | Front | Status | Objective |
|---|---|---|---|
| IMMORTAL-STATE-BOUNDARY-001 | Universal/application state boundary | **IN_PROGRESS / NEEDS-EVIDENCE** | Classify every relevant type/field in `IMMORTAL/state/EconomicStateV3.hs`, `IMMORTAL/kernel/EconomicKernel.hs`, profile code and PRE-RICH state as UNIVERSAL / PROFILE PARAMETER / APPLICATION STATE-RULE / ADAPTER REPRESENTATION / EVIDENCE / LEGACY before refactoring. |
| B2 | Numerical hysteresis | OPEN | Derive and verify exact semantics; do not promote application values into IMMORTAL constants. |
| B4 | ProtectedCapital preservation | OPEN | Formalize and test preservation through relevant transitions. |
| B5 | Economic Gate → Viability → Atomic Transition | OPEN | Make the complete admissibility chain explicit and testable. |
| B6 | V3 ↔ Cardano semantic equivalence | OPEN | Establish transition-level semantic correspondence for Issue / Reveal / Claim / Expire / Jackpot-related application transitions. |
| C1–C6 | Evidence / conformance | OPEN | Close evidence matrix without confusing tests/simulations with proofs. |
| 3D | Certified persistent NFT binding | OPEN | Close certified persistence/binding semantics and evidence. |
| VIABILITY-INF | Infinite-horizon viability | OPEN | Distinguish local safety from existence of a continuation strategy; no overclaiming. |
| BOUNDARY-SEPARATION | Complete IMMORTAL / PRE-RICH separation | OPEN | Remove or isolate PRE-RICH-shaped concepts from the universal kernel where evidence requires it. |

---

## 7. Current verified architectural concern

The current branch still contains PRE-RICH-shaped state concepts inside the V3 economic state/kernel, including:

- `TicketClass`;
- `TicketClassState`;
- `EconomicControlState`;
- `JackpotStatus`;
- `JackpotState`;
- current/highest class activation.

The kernel also uses structures such as `TicketClassState`, `classExposure` and `totalClassExposure`.

**Interpretation:** parameter separation has improved, but conceptual/state separation may still be incomplete.

**Rule:** do not refactor these blindly. First classify consumers, semantics, tests and documentation; then isolate/remove only what the evidence supports.

---

## 8. First triangulated state-boundary audit

### 8.1 Current branch implementation evidence

The live branch files were inspected directly:

- `IMMORTAL/state/EconomicStateV3.hs`
- `IMMORTAL/kernel/EconomicKernel.hs`
- `IMMORTAL/state/EconomicProfile.hs`
- `PRE-RICH/profile/PreRichEconomicProfile.hs`
- `plutus/B1LegacyAdapter.hs`

Observed facts:

1. `EconomicProfile` correctly externalizes concrete class prices and the maximum payout multiplier as application-supplied parameters.
2. PRE-RICH concretely supplies the ladder `1/2/3/5/10/25/50/100` and `500`.
3. `EconomicKernel.worstCaseExposure` consumes the profile multiplier rather than hard-coding 500 on this branch.
4. Nevertheless, `V3EconomicState` structurally embeds `v3Classes`, `v3Control` and `v3Jackpot`.
5. `EconomicKernel` derives exposure from `TicketClassState` and uses Jackpot/control state in economic calculations.
6. `B1LegacyAdapter` contains explicit fail-closed checks for unsupported protected-capital components, unsupported Jackpot state, historical control loss, and aggregate mismatch. This is evidence that the current legacy projection is not lossless for the full V3 state.

### 8.2 Triangulated Notion evidence

Current Notion sources searched/fetched include:

- **IMMORTAL — Economic Canon & Parameter Boundary Register v0.1**
- **Economic Rule Classification Matrix — Immortal Protocol / Adapter / PRE-RICH**
- **2026-09-21 — A1/A2/A3 Policy Closure — Ticket Expiry & Jackpot**
- **2026-09-21 — IMMORTAL Multi-Front Workflow Checkpoint**
- **IMMORTAL / PRE-RICH — End-to-End System Map & Continuity Checkpoint**
- **M3 — Chain Adapter & Serialization Boundary Design v0.1**

The economic canon confirms:

- worst-case exposure is a universal economic concept;
- the numeric payout bound is profile/application supplied;
- `500` is PRE-RICH policy, not IMMORTAL law;
- ProtectedCapital and RawSurplus are universal semantic concepts;
- implementation gaps must not reopen closed semantic decisions;
- the target architecture is a typed boundary between universal semantics and profile/application policy.

### 8.3 Preliminary classification

| Element | Current role | Preliminary classification | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TicketClass` | profile key / identifier | **PROFILE-BOUND TYPE / UNIVERSAL IDENTIFIER PRIMITIVE** | Do not delete; consider renaming/abstracting only if consumer audit proves value. |
| `TicketClassState` | per-class issued/unresolved/exposure/cap/saleability state | **APPLICATION/PROFILE STATE** | Candidate for extraction from universal state. Preserve while consumers are mapped. |
| `EconomicControlState` | current/highest activated class | **APPLICATION STATE / POLICY STATE** | Not universal absent proof that all DApps require activation hysteresis. |
| `JackpotStatus` | Jackpot lifecycle enum | **APPLICATION STATE** | Strong candidate to move outside universal state. |
| `JackpotState` | locked amount/threshold/status/cycle | **APPLICATION STATE** | Strong candidate to move outside universal state; universal layer should protect economically material locked obligations without requiring a Jackpot concept. |
| `v3CrystallizedLiabilities` | authoritative protected liability | **UNIVERSAL ECONOMIC STATE** | Retain in universal model. |
| `v3UnresolvedReserve` | aggregate unresolved accounting representation | **UNIVERSAL SEMANTIC ACCOUNTING CONCEPT, implementation representation still under audit** | Retain semantic role; avoid assuming the class-list representation is universal. |
| `v3UnresolvedTicketCount` | aggregate unresolved count | **UNIVERSAL / DERIVED ACCOUNTING STATE** | Retain if canonical specs require it; otherwise derive from obligations. |
| `v3SafetyCapital` | protected capital component | **UNIVERSAL SEMANTIC COMPONENT** | Retain; prove provenance/preservation. |
| `v3ReserveProtection` | protected capital component | **UNIVERSAL SEMANTIC COMPONENT** | Retain; prove provenance/preservation. |
| `v3MandatoryFutureCosts` | protected future obligations | **UNIVERSAL SEMANTIC COMPONENT** | Retain; prove provenance/preservation. |
| `epClassPrices` | concrete profile values | **PROFILE PARAMETER** | Correctly outside concrete IMMORTAL constants. |
| `epMaxNormalPayoutMultiplier` | concrete payout bound | **PROFILE PARAMETER** | Correctly profile-supplied. |
| `classExposure` | price × unresolved count by class | **UNIVERSAL CONCEPT, APPLICATION-SHAPED REPRESENTATION** | Generalize toward obligations/exposure interface; do not prematurely delete. |
| `classSaleable` | class activation/capacity policy | **APPLICATION RULE** | Should not be a universal economic primitive. |

### 8.4 Important architectural conclusion

The evidence supports a **conceptual split**, but does **not yet justify a destructive immediate refactor**.

The most likely target is:

`UniversalEconomicState`
+
`Profile/ApplicationState`
+
`EconomicProfile`

with a typed economic projection/interface from application state into universal obligations/exposure.

The universal kernel should reason about economically material obligations/exposure and admissibility, not require a ticket ladder or Jackpot merely because PRE-RICH currently has them.

However, the exact new Haskell types and transition signatures must be derived from all consumers and current V3/Cardano conformance tests before changing code.

---

## 9. Important legacy finding

`plutus/B1LegacyAdapter.hs` is currently a useful boundary witness:

- legacy → V3 rejects unresolved tickets, non-zero unresolved reserve mismatch, and locked Jackpot state rather than inventing semantics;
- V3 → legacy rejects non-zero SafetyCapital, ReserveProtection, MandatoryFutureCosts, locked Jackpot and historical-control loss;
- `legacyProjectionIsLossless` is explicitly conditional and therefore does not establish full V3 ↔ legacy equivalence.

**Implication:** the lossy legacy projection must not be used as the universal semantic model. B4/B6 remain open.

---

## 10. Search caveat

GitHub code search for this repository currently returns matches from the repository's indexed/default-branch history in some cases, not necessarily `work/immortal-green-closure`.

Therefore:

- direct fetches against the working branch are authoritative for current implementation inspection;
- default-branch search hits are treated as historical/provenance evidence until independently verified on the working branch;
- no refactor is based solely on an unverified default-branch search result.

This is a non-obvious anti-regression constraint for both sessions.

---

## 11. Current session result

### SESSION RESULT

**Session:** autonomous coordination session — 2026-09-21  
**Front:** IMMORTAL-STATE-BOUNDARY-001  
**Result:** completed first cross-source classification pass. Confirmed that parameter separation is substantially in place, while V3 state remains structurally mixed with PRE-RICH-shaped class/control/Jackpot concepts. Confirmed that the legacy B1 projection is intentionally lossy for several V3 components. No economic canon was changed.  
**Files changed:** `docs/COORDINATION/IMMORTAL_WORK_COORDINATION.md` only.  
**Tests run:** no code changes; no test suite required for this documentation-only audit.  
**Evidence:** current branch implementation; current Notion Economic Canon / Classification Matrix / A1-A3 Closure / Multi-Front Checkpoint / End-to-End System Map; legacy adapter implementation.  
**Remaining uncertainty:** exact universal state/type boundary and the minimal compatible refactor cannot be finalized until all V3 transition consumers and conformance tests are mapped.  
**Status:** DONE / NEEDS-EVIDENCE

---

## 12. Handoff

### HANDOFF

**Completed:**
- Created the shared coordination register.
- Triangulated the live branch state model against current Notion economic-boundary decisions.
- Classified the main V3 fields/types provisionally.
- Identified the legacy projection as intentionally non-lossless.

**Changed:**
- `docs/COORDINATION/IMMORTAL_WORK_COORDINATION.md`

**Verified:**
- `EconomicProfile` carries application values rather than universal numeric constants.
- `500×` is profile-supplied on the current branch.
- Jackpot/control/class activation remain structurally embedded in V3.
- ProtectedCapital components exist in V3 and are not all representable in legacy B1.

**Important findings:**
- Do not perform a big-bang V3 state refactor.
- The likely architectural target is universal economic state plus application/profile state with an explicit typed projection.
- `classExposure` is a universal economic concept but its current class-list representation is application-shaped.
- Jackpot should not become a universal state primitive merely because PRE-RICH currently uses it.

**Do not redo:**
- Do not re-audit closed A1/A2/A3 policy decisions from scratch.
- Do not treat 365 days, 500× or the PRE-RICH ladder as universal constants.
- Do not treat default-branch GitHub search hits as current-branch truth without verification.

**Next recommended action:**
1. Map all consumers of `V3EconomicState`, `TicketClassState`, `EconomicControlState`, `JackpotState`, `classExposure`, `protectedCapital`, and transition functions on `work/immortal-green-closure`.
2. Map the current V3 transition/action types and Cardano validator/adapter inputs.
3. Build a minimal compatibility matrix showing which fields are required by universal semantics versus PRE-RICH policy.
4. Only then design the smallest non-destructive type boundary refactor.
5. In parallel, continue B4/B5/B6 using the existing state until the new boundary is proven equivalent.

**Open uncertainty:**
- Whether some class-level aggregation is required by the universal canonical state for arbitrary DApps, or whether it can be generalized as an application-provided obligation/exposure projection.

**Evidence:**
- Current branch: `work/immortal-green-closure`
- Latest branch commit observed before coordination update: `9fa9dd68ec5be9060e419326d891dd5505094b81`
- Coordination commit: `74f81d8dd8ed3e19538c647133fcbdcfdee05ccd`

## 13. Conflict protocol

If sources disagree, record:

```text
CONFLICT

Source A:
Source B:
Date/version:
Authority:
Technical implication:
Required evidence:
Proposed resolution:
```

Resolve autonomously when the canonical evidence determines the answer. Escalate only irreducible normative/product choices.

---

## 14. Non-regression rules

Before moving, renaming or deleting an artifact:

1. find all consumers;
2. inspect tests;
3. inspect documentation/references;
4. inspect dependencies;
5. inspect this register for concurrent work;
6. classify the artifact as canonical / implementation / legacy / evidence / duplicate / incompatible;
7. make the smallest reversible change that preserves semantics.

Never weaken an invariant merely to make a test pass. If a fixture contradicts the economic model, fix the fixture unless new canonical evidence says the model is wrong.

---

## 15. Recent repository activity

The current branch recently recorded:

- `9fa9dd68` — close economic decision-boundary interface;
- `bdf39a63` — add end-to-end IMMORTAL system continuity map;
- `e79bcd46` — register GameRules replay vectors;
- `5a4f87f5` — add PRE-RICH GameRules replay vectors;
- `71860e98` — reconcile B3 payout-unit interpretation.

These are implementation/documentation evidence, not a replacement for the normative hierarchy.

---

## 16. Change log

### 2026-09-21 — Coordination register created

- Established cross-session handoff mechanism.
- Recorded current branch and latest observed commit.
- Recorded closed economic policy boundaries.
- Registered state-boundary audit as the active front.
- No protocol semantics changed by this file.

### 2026-09-21 — First state-boundary triangulation

- Triangulated current branch implementation against current Notion economic canon.
- Confirmed mixed universal/application state representation.
- Confirmed legacy B1 projection is intentionally lossy.
- Marked exact type boundary as NEEDS-EVIDENCE rather than inventing a refactor.
- Handed off consumer/conformance mapping as the next action.

---

## 17. Important rule

**The coordination file coordinates work; it does not define IMMORTAL.**

If this file ever conflicts with canonical specifications or consolidated normative decisions, the canonical source wins and this register must be corrected.
